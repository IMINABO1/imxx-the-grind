Make a hash map (or array of len n) of shifts for each index.
For each start, end, loop through start -> end to 
 add/subtract number of shifts held in hash map.
Set new array
Loop through hash map to fill in array with previous values
 and shifts applied.

Can't lie. It's God who told me this one ðŸ™Œ
Make an array of len(s)+1 fill with zeros, prefix_shifts.

You want to have a cummulative value of what you will be shifting each index with.
Consider the start and end in shifts.
loop through start, end, direction in shifts:
    shift = 1 if dir is 1 else -1
    increase prefix_shifts[start] by shift
    set prefix_shifts[end+1] to what will make the shift 0
    # That way, when the cummulative array is created from the prefix_shifts
    # The end point will be 0...
    # Actually, don't just SET prefix_shifts[end+1] to -shift
    increase prefix_shifts[end+1] by -shift sum
    # So that, if prefix_shifts[end+1] had a value before,
    # it will be updated accordingly
